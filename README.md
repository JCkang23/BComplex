# 🏢 CommercialSpace Manager

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in--progress-yellow)](#)
[![Tech Stack](https://img.shields.io/badge/stack-PERN-blueviolet)](#)

A full-stack web application for **landlords and renters** to efficienttly manage commercial rental spaces. It allows landlords to track rooms, contracts, and payments, while giving renters access to their lease details and communication tools — all within a secure, role-based platform.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals

- ✅ Develop **RESTful APIs** that are secure, scalable, and well-documented
- ✅ Build a **user-friendly interface** for both landlords and tenants
- ✅ Implement **secure authentication and role-based access**
- ✅ Learn and apply the **PERN stack**: PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, and Node.js
- ✅ Focus on **encryption, password hashing**, and other security best practices
